# This file serves a few purposes:
# - it is the target for the obfuscator--it gets the obfuscator to do both
#   the front end and back end together...  Because of this, it needs to live
#   in the root of the smartvideo directory structure.
# - It is the target for py2exe and routes calls between the front end and
#   the back end...  This is useful so we can have one executable that can
#   launch either the front end or the back end.
# - It handles a handful of things related to being a frozen app on Windows.

# Special imports to support all of our hacks.
# NOTE: Most other imports belong below!

    # translate it into ASCII because Microsoft doesn't believe in sanity and
    # standards. To fix this, we get the command line arguments in unicode
    # directly by using win32 API calls. Then we do some small modifications
    # and assign to 'sys.argv' so that it can be available app-wide.

#       docs, linecache.getline is used to retrieve the line number of source
#       code. However, we don't use this functionality _anywhere_ in our app.
#       I can't think of any reason why we would want this, except that maybe
#       this affects the way tracebacks work (maybe? I don't know). It does no
#       harm keeping it here, but if it's not needed, it should be removed.
