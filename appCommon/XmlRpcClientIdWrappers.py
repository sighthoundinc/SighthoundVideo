    ServerProxyWithClientId effectively needs a unique ID per method call that
    it can send to the remote server.  This allows the server to detect
    duplicate requests for the same method call and avoid performing the same
    action twice.

    Method IDs need to be completely unique, even if there are several
    processes all trying to talk to the same server.  Luckily, we only
    communicate on one machine, so we can use the PID to help facilitate this.
    We then use thread-local storage to get yet more unique (note that I don't
    think we ever actually communicate on more than one thread in a given
    process, but I haven't tracked down every XMLRPC call (especially those
    called in some indrect way with wx), so I'm being super paranoid.

    Basically, we have to know that we're talking to a XMLRPCServerWithClientId.
    We'll prepend some retry info as the first argument to every call.  That'll
    be stripped off on the other side and is usued to detect retries.  Here's
    how things work:

    1. If this is a new request and the server gets it, it will do it.
    2. If the communcation failed on the way _to_ the server, we'll get an error
       (I think), then we'll try again.  Assuming the 2nd one gets through, then
       the request will look new to the server and it will do it.
    3. If the communication failed on the way back form the server, we'll also
       get an error.  When we send the retry, the server will realize that it
       was the same request again (which is why we have the retry info) and
       will return us back the result from its cache.

    The server caches only the most recent request from each client.
