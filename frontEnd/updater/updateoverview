To post a new version:

1) open vitamind_video_mac.xml
2) Update 
	a) Versions to the svn change number
	b) shortVersionString to the user readable name
	c) length to the size of the DMG (this is optional but helps the progress dialog out)
	d) description to be the release notes for this version.

3) repeat for vitamind_video_windows.xml
  c) size of .exe
  

4) Upload the the new .xml files,  Vitamin D Video.dmg, and Vitamin D Video Setup.exe to the server. Currently that is www.vitamindinc.com/update/vitamindvideo/ . Greg can give you the FTP username and password if needed.



Debugging Tricks

You can override the path that the app uses by creating a file called updater.txt in the Applications Support/Vitamin D Video/ directory whose first line is the base (upto the vitamind_video_mac.xml) part of the url where you want to look for updates


How the installer works
1) Checks the server for the app cast (either vitamind_video_windows.xml or vitamind_video_mac.xml)
2) compares the version number of the app to the one on the server
3) If a new version is available, prompt the user if they want to download the new one
4) After the download succeeds
	Mac
	 copies the installer from the currently running app to /Libraries/Application Support/Vitamin D Video/
	 Runs that installer
	 
	Windows - Launches the Innosoft installer with the /silent flag
	
Making a new mac installer
	1) Build the project file frontend/updater/Macupdater/Updater.xcodeproj
	2) tar -cf installScriptApp.tar Updater.app on the results of the build
	3) copy that tar file to frontend/updater
