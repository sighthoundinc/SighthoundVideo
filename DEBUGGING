Troubleshooting Sighthound Video 
==============================================================================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Enabling debug logs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice: This is supposed to be an internal troubleshooting tool. It is expected
that support personnel will generate a config file with the debug settings enabled,
and provide the file to the customers with the instructions.

The debug configuration resides in the file debugPrefs in the Sighthound Video
data directory (so ~/Library/Application Support/Sighthound Video or
C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Sighthound Video).

The file is read at application start, so to be sure the settings are applied,
it is advised to place the file in the above folders and reboot.

File's structure is "name=value" pairs, with each setting residing on a separate line.
Example file's contents:

cameraLogLevel-Ubi=-10
cameraLogFfmpeg-Ubi=1
cameraStreamStats=20
backEndQueueStats=20
backEndQueueMaxSize=20
backEndQueueMaxExecTime=0.3


The following settings are currently supported (default in square brackets):


- cameraLogLevel [0]        - log level of camera process. For now, setting it 
                              to negative value is the only effective setting,
                              and it will unleash all available logging for all 
                              cameras. This setting can also be made module-specific
                              by appending the module name, e.g. "cameraLogLevel-MyModuleName".
                              If both are present, module-specific setting takes
                              precedence.
                              Module name may be: camera name, "NMS", "DiskCleaner",
                              "BackEnd", "UI", "Response", "WebServer"
- cameraLogFfmpeg [0]       - Setting this to non-zero value, will add ffmpeg's 
                              logging to logs already produced by the camera process.
- cameraLogModules [""]     - Comma-separated list of Modules to apply
                              trace log level to (by default, all).
                              The following module names can be used:
                                  "FFMPEG Demux"
                                  "Decoder"
                                  "Encoder"
                                  "Recorder"
                                  "Local Camera"
                                  "Live555 Demux"
                                  "Input Iterator"
                                  "Resize"
                                  "Splitter"
                                  "Limiter"
                                  "MMAP"
                                  "FFMPEG Filters"
                                  "Thread Connector"
                                  "Metadata Injector"
                                  "Audio renderer"
                                  "Mask Filter"
                                  "MediaFoundation Decoder" [Windows only]
                                  "Recorder Sync"
                                  "Sync Buffer"
                                  "Clip Reader"
                              This setting can also be made module-specific
                              by appending the module name, e.g. "cameraLogModules-MyModuleName".
                              If both are present, module-specific setting takes
                              precedence.
- cameraStreamStats [3600]  - interval at which camera statistics are to be logged
- backEndQueueMaxExecTime [0.5]
                            - execution time of a single event considered abnormal
                              no action is currently taken when it is encountered,
                              and we just count those instances instead
- backEndQueueMaxSize [50]  - size of backEnd queue considered abnormal
                              no action is currently taken when it is encountered,
                              and we just count those instances instead
- backEndQueueStats [3600]  - interval at which backEnd process statistics are
                              to be logged
- mmapDebug [3600]          - interval at which memory map access statistics will
                              be logged (grid view/monitor view)
