def abspathU(path):
    """A version of abspath that works if cwd() has non-ascii chars on Mac.

    This only matters if path parameter is a 'unicode' type.

    This is important because:
    1. On Mac, os.getcwd() returns a UTF-8 encoded str, not a unicode type.
    2. If the CWD has weird characters, they are encoded using UTF8
    3. If the relative path is unicode, python will try to convert the absolute
       part and relative part to unicode to join them.  This will fail, since
       the default str to unicode conversion assumes the str is ASCII.

    The fix is to use os.getcwdu().  Note that we only do this upon failure.
    Why?
    * On Windows, the default abspath() doesn't seem to have problems, and
      it goes through a different code path.  We want that other code path on
      Windows.
    * On Mac, we will preserve the notion that if the relative path is
      non-unicode, we'll still return a non-unicode value here.  That's not
      super great, but it is certainly the safest.

    @param  path  The path to make absolute; may be unicode or str type.
                  If str, should be in native path encoding.
