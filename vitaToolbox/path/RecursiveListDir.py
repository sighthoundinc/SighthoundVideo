    This is really just equivalent to 'find -name pathToDir'; well, except
    that it doesn't include the directories in the list.

    Here's a quick testcase, which creates a temp directory and make sure that
    we get the files we expect.

    >>> import tempfile, shutil
    >>> tmpDir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    >>> open(os.path.join(tmpDir, "one"), "w").close()
    >>> open(os.path.join(tmpDir, "two"), "w").close()
    >>> open(os.path.join(tmpDir, "three"), "w").close()
    >>> os.mkdir(os.path.join(tmpDir, "dir1"))
    >>> open(os.path.join(tmpDir, "dir1", "a"), "w").close()
    >>> open(os.path.join(tmpDir, "dir1", "b"), "w").close()
    >>> open(os.path.join(tmpDir, "dir1", "c"), "w").close()

    >>> open(os.path.join(tmpDir, "dir2", "f"), "w").close()

    >>> tmps = [ x[:len(tmpDir)] for x in l]
    >>> files = [ x[len(tmpDir):] for x in l]
    >>> assert tmps == [tmpDir] * 9
    >>> sorted(files)
    ['/dir1/a', '/dir1/b', '/dir1/c', '/dir2/d', '/dir2/e', '/dir2/f', '/one', '/three', '/two']

    @param  substitutePath  Pass a path in to use as a substitute for 'pathToDir'

                            directory tree that mirrors the original.
