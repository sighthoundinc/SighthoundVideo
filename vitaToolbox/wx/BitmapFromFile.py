def bitmapFromFile(f, platformBmps=True):
    """Create a wx.Bitmap from a file.

    We will use PIL to do the opening, then convert to a wx.Bitmap.  This
    shouldn't be needed (the wx constructor will open up an image file), but
    is used because wx.Bitmap seems to have trouble recognizing when a .png
    file has an alpha channel.  It seems to work OK with Photoshop-generated
    files, but doesn't seem to work with any of the files that I touch.

    This function also has the special feature of looking for platform-specific
    alternate bitmaps.

    @param  f             The path to the file to open; may also be a file-like
                          object (in that case, platformBmps is ignored).
    @param  platformBmps  If True and bitmaps were specified as paths to
                          bitmap files, we'll look for platform specific
                          bitmap files.  If they exist, they will be used.
                          See the main class docstring.
