        There appears to be a bug in Windows XP where SetDoubleBuffered(True)
        doesn't really work very well when any of our children use a
        wx.GraphicsContext to draw themselves.

        Also under Windows XP there is a bug when using this class that text
        with an alpha of 255 will not be drawn correctly.  One lame workaround
        is to set the alpha to 254 before calling gc.SetFont().

        This function will detect XP, then create a wx.GraphicsContext that will
        work properly.  Effectively, we will create a graphics context that
        points to an offscreen buffer.  Then, when you're done, we'll use a
        wx.DC call to blit it onto the real paint DC.

        @return gc        The graphics context.
        @return finishFn  Call this function to finish.
