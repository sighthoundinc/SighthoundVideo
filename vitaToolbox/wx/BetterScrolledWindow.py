from BindChildren import bindChildren

class BetterScrolledWindow(wx.ScrolledWindow):
    """Implements a version of wx.ScrolledWindow that is slightly saner.

    The major differences between this version of ScrolledWindow and the
    one that ships with wxPython:
    - It implements SetBestSize() properly, that lets you influence the value
      that's returned by GetBestSize() without messing with the min size.
    - It captures scrollwheel events from children.  At the moment, it's not
      very efficient at it, but it'll do.
    - The scrollbar doesn't need to be a multiple of scrollRate pixels, and
      doesn't need to be scrolled scrollRatePixels at a time.  This gets rid
      of the ugly partial line at the bottom of the scroll window.

    Since some of the workarounds implemented in this class are a bit hacky,
    I'd expect some amount of revisiting for future versions of wxPython
    and future platforms.

    Overall, mousewheel events seem to be all sorts of craziness on the two
    platforms I've tested (Mac and PC):
    - On Mac, they are sent to the control that the mouse is over.  On Windows,
      they are sent to whatever has focus in the topmost frame.
    - On Mac, they aren't passed up the container heirarchy.  On Windows, they
      are passed up the container heirarchy if not skipped (though not through
      the standard 'propagation' method that command events are).  On Mac, this
      means that if the mouse happens to be over a static label, the scroll
      wheel won't do anything.
    - On Mac, you will get two scroll events, unless you don't skip the first
      one.  They are different events: if the first event causes the mouse to
      be over a different object, the new object will be the 'eventobject' of
      the second event.
    - Horizontal scroll wheel events end up causing vertical scrolling.
    - On a PC, a multiline text control will 'skip' on mousewheel events (so
      the app will get a chance to see them), then won't actually scroll if the
      app eats them.  On a Mac, a multiline text control will 'skip' on
      mousewheel events (again, app can see them), but will still scroll even
      if the app eats them.

    Another attempted implementation of this class involved creating one big
    translucent window at the highest z-ordering.  This got all mousewheel
    events, but also stole all other mouse events (clicks, etc).  I couldn't
    find a way to get them passed down properly, thus that method wasn't used.

    Note: a version of this code was posted to the "wxPython in Action" forum
    by me.
