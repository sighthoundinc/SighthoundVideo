    """A sizer that puts all of its children right on top of one another.

    This sizer effectively lets you have your children overlap each other.
    Every child that you add to this sizer will be assigned the exact same
    location and size: all the full size of the sizer.

    This could be handy for dynamic UI (where the set of UI elements change
    depending on what is showing) or just for allowing you to have an object
    that is centered and another that is right aligned.

    Note: the min size of this sizer is the combination of the largest width
    of any child and the largest height of any child.

    Note that the flags / proportions of all children are ignored.  All children
    are set to full size.  No borders are looked at.  No centering.  No nothing.
