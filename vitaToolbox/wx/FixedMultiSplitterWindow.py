    """This class overrides functions from MultiSplitterWindow. This is needed
    because the original SplitterWindow and MultiSplitterWindow have certain bugs
    that needed to be addressed before it can be used.

    Bugs Fixed:
    - With the original classes, the sash is able to move off screen.
    - The window will cover up the right(bottom)-most window when the sash is to the far
        right(bottom) of the screen, and then having the window resized smaller towards the sash.
    - The size of the sash can't be changed.
    - The sash cannot be made invisible. Windows draws the sash with the background color of the window
        even if the window is set to transparent.
