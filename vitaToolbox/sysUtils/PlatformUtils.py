# NOTE: This file exists because the "platform" library that ships with
# python 2.5 is flaky on Windows.  Specifically, the builtin "platform"
# library tries to use win32 APIs (which we don't ship), relies on some command
# line programs, and also tries to parse lots of strings w/ heurstics.

# Python imports...
