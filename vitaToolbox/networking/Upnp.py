        # Really, we want to just tell the OS to give us multicast events on
        # _all_ interfaces.  You'd think there'd be a way to do that, and much
        # of the sample code seems to use INADDR_ANY as the parameter to
        # IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, implying that they are expecting to do just that.
        # ...but on my Mac (OS X version 10.5.8), that didn't seem to work.
        #
        # What did seem to work is to enumerate over all of my known IP
        # addresses and add all of them.  ...and since that should work on all
        # platforms, I just do that.
        #
        # ...but, there are some problems / weirdnesses.  Most notable:
        # - Really, we want to add _interfaces_ to the multicast group.  ...but
        #   there's no way that I can see to do that, so we have to add by IP
        #   address.  That means that if an interface has no IP address at
        #   the moment, there's no way to add it to the multicast gorup.  That's
        #   why we tell the caller to call us back whenever our IP addresses
        #   change, so we can try to add any new interfaces.
        # - A given interface may have more than one IP address.  This is
        #   multihoming.  When this happens, we'll fail to do some of the
        #   "add membership" calls (the os will complain that we're trying to
        #   double-add an interface).  We just ignore those errors.
        # - When IPs disappear, we don't un-add them.  Honestly, we really want
        #   to be listening to all interfaces, so why would we unadd?  ..and it
        #   could be a really bad idea if you were multi-homed and then one of
        #   those IP addresses disappeared.
        #
        # Another random comment is that I know that we're supposed to do an
        # IGMP join for multicast.  I'm assuming that the OS does that for us,
        # but haven't actually sniffed the network to confirm.  Some web
        # searches I did implied this, so hope it's true.
