        Note:  If the coordinate space was never set before, (meaning, a call
               to self.getCoordSpace() returns None) the value passed in
               will be the new coordinate space for this region. However,
               if the coordinate space is already set, this region will
               be scaled from the old coordinate space to the new coordinate
               space, and the new coordinate space is kept for this region. This
               is done for several reasons:

               - When the region has no coordinate space, there's no
                 telling what coordinate space it belongs to. In this case,
                 we assume that the region is being told which coordinate
                 space it belongs to. Therefore, the new coordinate space is
                 set, and no scaling is performed.

               - When the region has a coordinate space, then it shouldn't
                 be allowed to be easily changed, since other objects might be
                 listening to changes made to this object. However, a new
                 coordinate space might be desirable if changing aspect ratios.
                 Therefore, when setting a new coordinate space, the internal
                 data is scaled to match the new coordinate space from the old
                 one. Finally, the new coordinate space is kept for this region.
