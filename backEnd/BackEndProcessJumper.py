# Here's an attempt to describe what's going on here, and why it's different
# between different platforms.
#
# On MacOS, we use "fork" to start our subprocesses.  What happens here is that
# the current process is cloned (using a whole bunch of virtual memory tricks)
# and then the parent and child go along their merry ways.  If a parent
# allocated a bunch of memory (or imported a library) before the child forked
# and neither the parent or the child changes that memory, then they both get
# to share that memory/import.  This can be good.  However, if a parent
# allocates a bunch of memory (or imports libraries) that the child doesn't
# really need, forks the child, then changes that memory, then the child has
# a wasted copy of memory.  It's hard to balance these two things, but here's
# what we do on Mac:
#   We do the import of the required module _just before_ forking. Any future
#   processes will get the benefit (or penalty) of already having the import.
#   This is especially interesting for the camera processes, which have a large
#   overhead for import (but can potentially share stuff between processes
#   through us, the parent).
#
# ...if we wanted to, we could pick and choose different strategies for
# different imports depending on how much shared import state we thought the
# different children could share with each other.
#
# On Windows, we don't have "fork".  That means that each subprocess starts up
# a whole new copy of python and there is no memory sharing (other than read-
# only memory).  In this case, we really don't want the parent to load up
# anything it doesn't have to--there's no chance that children will share it.
