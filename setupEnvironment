# Shell script to setup the environment for SmartVideo.
# This is intended to be sourced by other scripts, since that's the only way
# that it can modify the caller's environment.  In other words, run with
#   source setupEnvironment
#
# Things that this script does
# * Modify path-like variables (PATH, PYTHONPATH, DYLD_XXX_PATH) to point to
#   our libraries.
# * Create a few environment variables describing where certain libraries are,
#   in case other people need to find them.
#
# Conventions:
# * Variables starting with _se_ should be considered private to this Makefile.
#   If you need them elsewhere, rename them (PLEASE!)
# * When you see DIR, that will be a Windows dir on Windows ("C:\...").  When
#   you see UNIXDIR, that will always be a unix dir ("/cygdrive/c/...").  On
#   Mac, these should always be the same.

# Only execute this file once...
